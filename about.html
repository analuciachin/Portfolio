        <h1>About me</h1>
        <p>Hello, my name is Ana Lucia. Soon to be a bootcamp student. I am currently working as a Data Analyst, however, I would love to find a position as a Front-end developer. I also have a huge interest in UX/UI design and slowly I want to move toward becoming a front-end developer with a solid knowledge in UX/UI.</p>
        <p>Right now I am participating in the #100DaysOfCode challenge where I have committed to coding everyday for 100 days and posting my daily work on Twitter. My goal with the challenge is to learn Redux, review Bootstrap and CSS and practice React and JS as much as I can by working on projects.</p>
