            <p>Hello, my name is Ana Lucia. Soon to be a bootcamp student. I am a data analyst transitioning to become a Front-end developer.</p>
            <p>Working as a data analyst, I have developed analytical skills and logical thinking and I have a great understanding of SQL and databases as I have been working in the field for over 10 years.</p>
            <p> I also have a huge interest in UX/UI design and slowly I would like to move towards becoming a front-end developer with a solid knowledge in UX/UI.</p>
            <p>Right now I am participating in the #100DaysOfCode challenge where I have committed to code everyday for 100 days and posting my daily work on Twitter. My goal with the challenge is to learn Redux, review Bootstrap and CSS and practice React and JS as much as I can by working on projects.</p><a href='https://twitter.com/analucia_chin'>Follow my journey</a>
