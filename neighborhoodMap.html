            <p class='p-desc text-justify'>Neighborhood Map shows the Montreal city featuring some turistic locations. By clicking a location pin, a popup opens to give the user more information about the selected place (data from Wikipedia API). The map also allows the user to browse the content in different ways.</p>

            <p class='p-desc text-justify'>The Neighborhood Map was the last project from the Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree program at Udacity. It was a React project and we had to build it from scratch. We were not given any initial code to work on, only the guidelines on how to complete the project.</p>
            <p class='p-desc text-justify'>The goal of this project was to develop a single page application featuring a map of a neighborhood and adding third-party data to give us more information about these locations.</p>

          <div class='col-md-5 mt-4'>
            <p class='p-desc text-justify'>Once the map is loaded, the user will see a list of the touristic places in Montreal on the left and a map of Montreal with the red location pins on the right side. For the map I have used the google-maps-react library.</p>

            <h3 class='font-italic text-justify'>Problems and Thought Process</h3>
            <p class='p-desc text-justify'>The Neighborhood Map was the first project that I did from scratch, without the support of any initial code. The first challenge I had was to think about the code structure and design, figuring out which components I needed to create and the props I had to pass from one to another. After that was deciding which React Google Maps library to use.</p>
            <p class='p-desc text-justify'>I decided to go with google-maps-react after reading its documentation and checking its latest updates.</p>

            <h3 class='font-italic text-justify'>Lessons Learned</h3>
            <p class='p-desc text-justify'>By working on this project, I have learned how to start a project from scratch. Thinking about the structure and design before jumping into the code. I have also learned what to check before choosing a component's library, reading through API and library documentations and testing API calls via POSTMAN.</p>
